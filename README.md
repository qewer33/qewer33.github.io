# qewer33's Personal Website

This is the source for my personal website. Check it over at https://qewer.dev

The project is based on the Svelte + Vite template (Svelte as the frontend framework and Vite as the bundler). The background of the website is a dynamic p5.js sketch, it lives under `public/static_assets/sketch`. PRs and improvements are always welcome. You can also fork this project and modify it to be your own personal website but be sure to use a GPLv3 compatible license, credit isn't necessary but would be appreciated.
